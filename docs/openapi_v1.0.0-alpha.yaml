      description: |
        **WARNING: this endpoint may live under a different domain, path or both depending on the supplier endpoint URL returned by the GET /suppliers.**

        For any dates which are never available for booking, the response MUST exclude those dates entirely.

        If the product's `availabilityType` is `OPENING_HOURS` then the `localDateTimeStart` and `localDateTimeEnd` are the hours of operation. If a product has more than one hours of operation on the same day (e.g. the supplier is open 8-5 but closed for lunch from 12-1) then one availability object MUST be returned for each contiguous range of time for that day.

        The availability `id` value MUST be sent when making a Booking request.

        The `status` field SHOULD be used to infer how frequently your cache should be updated from the Booking Platform. The RECOMMENDED frequency is as follows:

          * `FREESALE`: Always available. Refresh no more than once/week.
          * `AVAILABLE`: Currently available for sale, but has a fixed capacity. Refresh every 12 hours.
          * `LIMITED`: Currently available for sale, but has a fixed capacity and may be sold out soon. Refresh at least once/hour.
          * `SOLD_OUT`: Currently sold out, but additional availability may free up. Refresh no more than once/hour.
          * `CLOSED`: Currently not available for sale, but not sold out (e.g. temporarily on stop-sell) and may be available for sale soon. Refresh no more than once/12 hours.

        **WARNING: this endpoint may live under a different domain, path or both depending on the supplier endpoint URL returned by the GET /suppliers.**

        This request is intended to provide the Booking Platform a complete view of the Unit IDs, Unit quantity, and Availability IDs so that additional restrictions and policies can be validated within the Booking Platform prior to making a Booking. The purpose is to provide a clear and accurate answer to the Reseller about whether the requested booking configuration could be accepted by the Supplier. This is to support complex booking requirements without the Reseller needing to know the details of the restriction (e.g. "must purchase at least 1 adult ticket if a child ticket is purchased").

        This creates a new pending booking.

        This call has to be idempotent. To be able to safely retry a call on any network error or timeout, therefore it MUST not fail on retry or create a duplicate booking. The idempotency key is the UUID. A supplier SHOULD verify that a retried request with the same UUID is matching the original booking data, to avoid erroneous clients generating repeating UUIDs and response with the status 400 and ErrorCode 1005 in such case.

        This expires the availability hold of an in-progress booking so that the availablity is release for other bookings. This request is a courtesy, however Resellers SHOULD send this in order to ensure proper cleanup of any outstanding holds.

        This call has to be idempotent. To be able to safely retry a call on any network error or timeout, therefore it MUST not fail on retry. The idempotency key is the UUID.

            A high level classification of the error category.  
            `illegalOperationError`: The client is trying to perform an operation that does not comply with certain business logic. Eg.: Trying to cancel a booking while the cancellation window has passed.  
            
            `inputValidationError`: One or more input parameters contain invalid values or are missing.  
            
            `unknownError`: A last-resort fallback option in case none of the other error classes seem appropriate. Usage of this error class is discouraged.
        errorMessage:
          type: string
          nullable: false
          description: |
            Contains a clear, human readable error message that properly describes the issue which MAY comply with the following rules:
            * No capitalization
            * No punctuation other than a comma
            * Field names must:
              * Be enclosed by < and > symbols
              * Contain a full path to the value, including array indexes
          example: 'invalid or missing parameter <units[0].id>'
        errorCode:
          type: string
          nullable: false
          description: |
            Contains a namespaced error code.  
            The namespace is used to distinguish between core errors and the errors of custom capabilities the server may have implemented and
              MUST match the regular expression /[a-z\-]*\/[0-9]{4}\/[a-zA-Z \-]*/.  
              
            The `9000-9999` range is reserved for official OCTo error codes.  
            The `0000-8999` range can be used for scenarios that aren't covered by the OCTo spec.  
            When no specific error code applies, use 9000.  
            In serious cases use 9999 accompanied by an HTTP 500 status code. 
              
            ## Prescribed error codes
            Using error codes allows the client to programmatically handle errors or determine the gravity of the errors.  
            The following is a selection of errors codes that should be implemented explicitly.  
            Failure to do so makes is much harder for a client to re-use the same code with a different partner, without having to adjust to the new partner's errors.  
            
            `9000`: Generic error  
            `9001`: Invalid or missing input  
            `9002`: Unknown value provided  
            `9003`: Date in the past  
            `9004`: Insufficient availability  
            `9005`: Cancellation not allowed  
            `9006`: Date range too large  
            `9007`: Reservation expired  
            `9008`: Hold period too long  
            `9009`: Cannot extend hold period  
            `9010`: Reservation ID not found  
            `9999`: Generic error for all unexpected / unknown cases  
              
          example: 'core/9000'
        retryable:
          type: boolean
          nullable: false
          description: |
            The OCTO spec distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors. Typically any error is non-retryable, but there are a few exceptions. 
              * A __non-retryable__ error is an error that indicates human intervention is needed. For example
                * Invalid product / unit ID provided - This suggests there is a mapping problem due to a changed configuration
                * Insufficient credits - The outstanding rolling deposit with the supplier has depleted and a top-up is needed to continue sales. Note that support for this is not included in the core API specification.
                * Authentication failure - Credentials may need to be updated
              * A __retryable__ error is an error that the consumer of the API generally won't have to take action on. The supplier is likely to find out about the issue and is bound to fix it soon and the call can simply be retried later. This includes situations like
                * Time outs / down-time
                * Server errors like HTTP 500 without error object in the response body
                * No more availability for a date / timeslot while placing an order

            This MUST be an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) compliant date and time. The value represents the time at which the cancellation was confirmed. This will typically be the same as `utcConfirmedAt` however if the cancellation request required manual approval from the Supplier, it may be different.
          example: '2019-10-31T08:30:00Z'
    CancelReason:
      type: string
      enum:
        - CUSTOMER
        - SUPPLIER
        - FRAUD
        - OTHER
      description: |
        This value indicates the reason that the cancellation request was sent.

        * `CUSTOMER` is the most common and indicates that the customer requested the cancellation.
        * `SUPPLIER` indicates that the supplier requested the cancellation (possibly due to bad weather or other unexpected circumstances).
        * `FRAUD` indicates that the booking cancellation is being requested by the Reseller because it has been determined the booking was fraudulent.
        * `OTHER` indicates that the cancellation reason does not fall into one of these categories. This SHOULD be used only in rare circumstances.
      example: 'CUSTOMER_REQUESTED'

        revision:
          type: integer
          description: |
            This represents which revision of the capability is supported. This is not a version numbers and therefore there is no implied version compatibility like you would have with a semantic version, therefore if multiple revisions are supported, then one Capability object should be returned for each revision that is supported.
          example: 2
        required:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            This indicates whether the capability is merely supported or strictly required. Resellers that don't support the capability or specific revision will use this flag to filter out products they are unable to support.

      description: |
        This indicates the reason for extending the booking hold.

        * `FRAUD_CHECK` is the most common scenario where additional time is required to ensure that the booking is not being made using fraudulent payment information.
        * `CUSTOMER_REQUESTED` is intended for scenarios where the customer is actively completing the checkout process but requires some additional time to complete. The Reseller SHOULD try to ensure that customers may only extend their booking once.
        * `OTHER` can be used in other unusual circumstances but SHOULD not be abused to maintain a hold without good reason. If this value is specified the Reseller SHOULD provide `reasonDetails` to explain the justification.

          description: |
            This indicates whether the Reseller can expect an immediate confirmation of whether the Supplier has accepted the booking. If `false` then the Reseller MUST be able to delay confirmation to the customer while waiting for the Supplier to accept or reject the Booking.

            When `instantConfirmation` is set to `false` one should expect created bookings to first get into a `PENDING` state.
          example: true
        instantDelivery:
          type: boolean
          description: |

        This is the RECOMMENDED refresh interval for the Reseller and SHOULD be used by the Reseller to control the frequency at which they make a `getBooking` request for the following scenarios:

        * To see if a booking has changed out of a `PENDING` status into `CONFIRMED` or `REJECTED`.
        * To see if a booking has had any new Vouchers or Tickets delivered for the booking.
        * To see if a booking has changed from `CONFIRMED` to `CANCELLED` in the event of a supplier-initiated cancellation.
        * To see if a booking has an updated `utcRedeemedAt`/`utcResolvedAt` value for the Voucher or any of the Tickets.

        This value indicates the expected refund from the Supplier.
        * `FULL` indicates that the Supplier has fully refunded the booking and will not be paid by the Reseller for this booking. This is the expected state when a valid cancellation request is made before any cancellation cutoff policy or when a Supplier approves a cancellation request that was made after the cutoff.
        * `PARTIAL` indicates that the Supplier has agreed to partially refund the customer. This may be due to a cancellation policy that grants a partial refund or because the Supplier has agreed to partially refund the customer when the cancellation policy would otherwise have not allowed any refund.
        * `NONE` indicates that no refund will be given by the Supplier. The customer may still be refunded by the Reseller but the Supplier MUST still be paid for this booking.
      example: 'FULL'
    Status:

        - CANCELLED
      description: |
        After a successful `createBooking` request, the `status` MUST be `ON_HOLD`.

        After a successful `confirmBooking` request, the `status` MUST be `CONFIRMED`.

        After a successful `confirmCancellation` request, the `status` MUST be `CANCELLED`.

        Following are the only valid Booking flow status transitions:

        * New Booking -> `REJECTED`
        * New Booking -> `ON_HOLD` -> `EXPIRED`
        * New Booking -> `ON_HOLD` -> `CONFIRMED`
        * New Booking -> `ON_HOLD` -> `PENDING` -> `REJECTED`
        * New Booking -> `ON_HOLD` -> `PENDING` -> `CONFIRMED`

        The `PENDING` status MAY appear only for products with the `instantConfirmation` property set to `false`. Poll the /bookings endpoint for status changes.

        Following are the only valid Cancellation flow status transitions:

        * `CONFIRMED` -> `CANCELLED`
